# Heartbeat

On heartbeat, check in this order:

1. **Linear standup** — run `node /root/clawd/skills/linear-issue-manager/scripts/linear-api.cjs urgent` to check for P1 issues
2. **Memory maintenance** — review today's memory file, consolidate important items to MEMORY.md
3. **If nothing needs attention** — reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`

Do NOT repeat old tasks from prior chats. Only act on what's current.
