### Summary
Joshua Fischburg and Shawn Segal discussed Shawn Segal's extremely busy workload, ongoing business issues including a Sumup terminal replacement and legal matters with Valmar and Clover/First Data, and a new partnership with JB Brands, for which Shawn Segal recently held a salesman coaching workshop. Joshua Fischburg introduced the concept of agentic AI, built on Openclaw and hosted on Cloudflare, and conducted a discovery session with Shawn Segal, who detailed needs for automation in inventory management, scheduling, payroll, and reminders for license renewals. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for Thursday, the 5th, at 2:00 PM Eastern to present a proof of concept for the system, and Shawn Segal committed to establishing a monthly payment plan via Zelle with Joshua Fischburg to address their balance.

#### Details
Audio Check and Setup: Joshua Fischburg and Shawn Segal began the call with an audio check, as Joshua Fischburg was attempting to establish a new, standardized process for their meetings. Shawn Segal noted that they could barely hear Joshua Fischburg initially, requiring adjustments to the volume (00:00:00) (00:06:36). Joshua Fischburg acknowledged that Shawn Segal was acting as a guinea pig for this new setup (00:06:36).
Shawn Segal's Overwhelming Workload: Shawn Segal expressed that they were having an extremely busy week, expecting to work between 85 and 90 hours. They reported several ongoing issues, including problems with a replacement Sumup point-of-sale terminal, which was not fixed and required new hardware expected by the end of March. They also mentioned a trial hearing scheduled for the following week regarding a burglary that occurred the previous year (00:04:40).
Current Business and Personal Developments: Shawn Segal is currently focused on budgeting with George for Clover/First Data, and they are preparing for small claims court against Valmar. Shawn Segal also mentioned an ongoing dispute with their condo landlord regarding a significant water spot (00:04:40). Furthermore, Shawn Segal’s sister called out of work, adding to their slack, and their sister’s baby is expected sooner than anticipated (00:05:34).
New Business Partnership and Workshop: Shawn Segal announced a soft new partnership with JB Brands, the manufacturer of Tyson brand vapes, which Jordan and they are pushing forward. Shawn Segal spent the previous day at JB Brands' warehouse in Miami conducting a salesman coaching workshop for their physical and remote sales staff (00:05:34).
Troubleshooting Connection Issues: Joshua Fischburg experienced issues logging into the necessary platform, attempting to log in by phone number, QR code, and pass key (00:06:36). Shawn Segal mentioned they would need to install and recover their Telegram account to use the application, which Joshua Fischburg noted is the preferred secure way to interact with the app (00:07:34).
Solo Coverage and Meeting Interruption: Shawn Segal was alone covering the store because their sister called out, meaning they had additional responsibilities such as resetting the cash drawer and counting cash (00:07:34). Shawn Segal had to interrupt their conversation with Joshua Fischburg to address a customer who requested they return in 30 minutes for a pitch, suggesting the meeting might need to pause or end within that time frame (00:08:31).
Confirmation of Personal News: Shawn Segal confirmed that their pregnant sister is due sooner than expected, noting they were confident they were not supposed to share this news (00:09:09). Joshua Fischburg offered congratulations and promised confidentiality (00:10:02).
Introduction to Agentic AI and Platform: Joshua Fischburg transitioned to explaining the concept of agentic AI, which goes beyond typical chat apps by defining an agent that can manage and build other agents and skills. Joshua Fischburg intends to use the desktop for discovery and needed Shawn Segal to install Telegram for support, group chat, and expert user interactions, as it would be used to communicate with the agent (00:10:02) (00:12:51).
Agent Management and Project Tracking (Linear): Joshua Fischburg demonstrated how the agents manage projects and delegate tasks within the Linear application, which they described as the "pen ultimate platform" for project management and organization (00:12:51). This system integrates agents, manages each project, and includes specialist agents for specific tasks (00:14:11). Joshua Fischburg explained that the system reports progress to them and assigns work for review and approval (00:15:58).
Openclaw and Agent Capabilities: The platform is built on Openclaw, which allows the AI to use an entire computer, including the internet, GPUs, and potentially a credit card to meet a goal (00:15:58). A cautionary tale was shared about an agent that spent $5,000 to meet a goal of 10x brand image in 90 days, leading to the lesson that the system must be secured properly and not simply installed on a laptop (00:17:12).
Security and Hosting via Cloudflare: Shawn Segal inquired if the platform required any third-party downloads outside of Telegram, as their phone is restricted (00:18:03). Joshua Fischburg confirmed the whole system is built in a secure sandbox and hosted on Cloudflare (00:19:11). Cloudflare is a platform that hosts domains, provides security, and manages websites in a high-performance, node-based manner, moving away from older technologies like WordPress (00:20:00).
Web Hosting and Workers: The agentic stack is used for standard website templates, managing, building, and interacting with customers on the website (00:21:13). The system also includes "workers," which are functions with access to compute, storage, and memory, used for problem-solving and solution engineering (00:22:19). Joshua Fischburg mentioned building an ERP database that syncs products, customers, and transactions (00:23:22).
Video Analysis and Presentation Tweak: Shawn Segal asked if they could upload a video for analysis, such as the workshop video for JB Brands, to have the agent tweak and fine-tune the presentation. Joshua Fischburg confirmed this capability, stating they had built an almost identical feature for dividing up a video and performing actions with the resulting segments (00:23:22) (00:32:55).
Customer Interaction and Successful Sale: Shawn Segal successfully assisted a customer looking for Fume Infinities, recommending the Iron Mics (Mike Tyson's brand) instead. They provided samples with silicone tips and detailed instructions on adjusting the airflow (00:25:35). The customer ultimately purchased the Tyson brand vape, which Shawn Segal deemed a successful conversion (00:29:44) (00:31:29).
API Key Requirement and Physical Interruption: Joshua Fischburg confirmed that using agents, which interact via API, requires an API key because every word costs money, unlike an "all you can eat" chat plan (00:32:55). The discussion was paused when Shawn Segal had to address the owner of Wicked, the adjacent business, regarding an ongoing issue with the dumpster and waste management (00:33:51).
Complex Issues and Tenant Coordination: Shawn Segal reported that they had become the default representative for most tenants dealing with the property management and landlord (00:35:26). Shawn Segal had communicated with Shana about getting a lock/bar on the dumpster due to others dumping food, an issue that will be followed up on the following week (00:33:51).
Discovery Session Start and Role Definition: Joshua Fischburg officially began the discovery session to understand how the agent could best help Shawn Segal (00:35:26). Shawn Segal identified their role as the owner/operator and CFO of a smoke and vapor shop, working with a team of six and several dozen vendors (00:36:20). Shawn Segal also confirmed that JB Brands is a collaborator (00:37:25).
Needs for Automation and Reminders: Shawn Segal expressed a need for assistance with research, delegation, and automation, including reminders for annual renewals for local, state, and federal licenses, and bi-weekly payroll reminders (00:37:25). They also want automation for creating the monthly staff schedule (00:38:28).
Workload Prioritization and Existing Tools: Shawn Segal does not follow a set daily schedule but prioritizes tasks based on deadlines, using a notepad on their phone (00:39:24). Their current tools include email (using Gmail, moving away from Outlook), Google Calendar, notes, Gemini, WhatsApp, and regular text/phone calls (00:40:28).
Organization and Task Management: Shawn Segal manages their schedule by building it on a color-coded whiteboard and posting a picture to Discord, as their Sumup point of sale only allows for one-week schedules (00:38:28). They manually create events and tasks with reminders in Google Calendar for organization (00:41:38). Shawn Segal confirmed they would be open to a new solution for scheduling, prioritizing, and tracking tasks professionally (00:42:39).
File Storage and Social Media Challenges: Shawn Segal stores most important physical files in a cabinet and digital files on the shop PC and shared OneDrive. For communication, they use Discord, WhatsApp, regular text, and occasionally Instagram for customer interaction (00:47:47). They have given up on Instagram posting for the foreseeable future due to being shadowbanned and receiving notices for violating Meta's age restrictiveness terms (00:48:49).
Identifying Pain Points: The most time-consuming tasks for Shawn Segal are orders and managing inventory. Tasks that should be automated include inventory management, payroll, scheduling, and placing orders (00:49:47). Maintaining a healthy stock level often falls through the cracks due to the number of vendors, back orders, and sourcing from other distributors or shops (00:50:53).
Ideal Assistant Role and Agent Focus: With unlimited digital support, Shawn Segal would pay an assistant to handle monotonous and tedious work, bringing items like orders and the monthly schedule for final approval (00:52:05). Shawn Segal stated that the number one thing they would want Hard Shell to do is inventory management and order automation (00:55:47).
AI Access Comfort and Proactivity: Shawn Segal is comfortable giving the AI access to their email and files, but "with limits" (00:54:50). They confirmed they want the agent to be proactive, checking in with them, providing reminders, and surfacing alerts, particularly if a deadline is approaching (00:56:46).
Agent Personality and Integrations: Shawn Segal's ideal assistant personality would be like their friend Nicole: strict, regimented, and focused on meeting deadlines. They want the agent to be accessible across all devices (laptop, phone, tablet) (00:57:45). Must-have integrations include the Sumup point-of-sale system for inventory, back office, sales tracking, and shrinkage. Additionally, they requested optional integrations for a daily motivational message and a joke (00:58:54).
Conclusion of Discovery and Proposed Follow-up: Joshua Fischburg confirmed the conclusion of the discovery phase and proposed a "part two" meeting to present a proof of concept for the system, which will include baseline components but not integrations yet. They will set up a Cloudflare account for Shawn Segal, instantiate the system, and have it ready to go (01:00:49).
Scheduling the Next Meeting: They agreed to schedule the follow-up meeting for Thursday, the 5th, at 2:00 PM Eastern time, as Wednesday was tricky for Joshua Fischburg (01:01:46). Shawn Segal confirmed their availability, noting they are booked up until Sunday with various commitments (01:00:49).
Customer Interaction and Retail Operations: Shawn Segal paused the conversation to address a customer, discussing product availability, including Georgia Peach and Watermelon Ice, and detailing the store's custom 3D-printed wallets (01:02:32). The custom wallets were developed to be a cheaper alternative to the Ridge wallet, costing between \$14 and \$25 depending on customization (01:04:07).
Legal Update on Valmar Litigation: Shawn Segal provided an update on the legal situation with Valmar, stating they decided to proceed with small claims litigation if Valmar does not respond by the upcoming Monday. George will assist with the small claims process privately, outside of their law firm, due to issues with George's associate's billing and a new firm policy requiring a $5,000 minimum retainer balance for commercial clients, which escalates to $50,000 for litigation (01:07:05).
Updates on Clover First Data Case and George's Firm Status: George is tasked with building a six-month and one-year budget for the Clover First data case (01:08:48). Shawn Segal noted that the revised retainer policy at George's firm, which they are a contributing factor to, might lead George to leave and open their own private firm to better serve clients (01:08:01).
Sales Performance and Business Outlook: Shawn Segal confirmed that the current legal issues have no bearing on their current plan, and they are generally on track for the first of the month, despite February being their slowest month due to it being short, post-holiday spending habits, and New Year's resolutions impacting their industry (01:10:28). Although sales are not where they wanted to be, they are still within the expected range (01:11:24).
Establishing Payment Plan and Finalizing Next Steps: Shawn Segal committed to scheduling a date and confirmed amount for monthly payments via Zelle until their balance is satisfied in full. Their only request was for Joshua Fischburg to send a new statement reflecting the current balance after each Zelle payment is sent (01:11:24). The meeting concluded with confirmation that Joshua Fischburg sent the calendar invite for the next week's meeting .

Suggested next steps
Shawn Segal will follow up with Shana next week regarding the dumpster issues and updates on Isgar.
Shawn Segal will install Telegram and recover the account to use the app for support and group chat interaction with the agent.
Shawn Segal will determine how to clearly mark sensitive internal documents as out of bounds for the Hard Shell agent.
Shawn Segal will secure an API key or a login from SumUp to give the agent access to inventory, back office for scheduling, inventory management, tracking, and ordering.
Joshua Fischburg will send a new statement reflecting the current balance every month after the Zelle payment is sent.
Joshua Fischburg will present a proof of concept of the system, including the little baseline bits and pieces, but not the integrations, and set up a Cloudflare account for Shawn Segal during a part two meeting.

00:07:34

Shawn Segal: I just haven't used it in a very long time. Um, I would have to go install it, recover my account, and sign into
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Um Telegram is a great way to use this app.
Shawn Segal: it.
Joshua Fischburg: It's secure and it's you're not chatting with um sorry I'm I'm thinking and doing at the same time. It's a dangerous thing sometimes. devices. Okay. And I want to do this. Okay. Go to desktop. Okay. There we go. Yay. Link. Okay.

00:09:09

Shawn Segal: Okay.

Joshua Fischburg: All right. So,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: we're gonna Oh,
Shawn Segal: Sorry. Today just frazzled.
Joshua Fischburg: I can tell you mentioned
Shawn Segal: Yeah,
Joshua Fischburg: baby.
Shawn Segal: my my sister is uh pregnant and she's not due until the end of next month, but um that apparently is now no longer the
Joshua Fischburg: Oh,
Shawn Segal: case.
Joshua Fischburg: this is very new news. Wow.
Shawn Segal: Yeah, she she hasn't told anybody and I'm I'm actually fairly confident I wasn't supposed to share it with you. I'm not I'm not allowed to share it with most people. She's trying to keep it secret. Um but it you know, you're f****** 15 states away.


00:10:02

Joshua Fischburg: I'm not gonna tell anybody,
Shawn Segal: I don't give a s***.
Joshua Fischburg: but wow. Well,
Shawn Segal: Right.
Joshua Fischburg: I I won't even I mean, congratulations.
Shawn Segal: Saying, "What are you going to tell your wife and Sydney?"
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah, I mean, yeah, they'd be probably pretty excited,
Shawn Segal: Cool.
Joshua Fischburg: but um Okay, so let me show you like you obviously know how traditional chat apps work. Have you done anything agentic yet?
Shawn Segal: Yes.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay,
Shawn Segal: No.
Joshua Fischburg: cool. Great opportunity then. Um, I've moved over from my laptop to the desktop, which is where I'm going to do discovery. So, I'm actually going to cheat a little bit and just show you how this thing works. So, bear with me. And once I set this up, I never have to do it again. But, as I mentioned, you are a
Shawn Segal: a new dealer. Do I need to do I need to install Telegram and recover that
Joshua Fischburg: I Yeah, if you if I think that's the right way to do it.


00:10:50

Shawn Segal: account?
Joshua Fischburg: Um because we're going to run all our support and group chat and uh
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: like expert user things and then you know in that and then you're going to use uh you're going to use telegram to interact with the
Shawn Segal: Okay,
Joshua Fischburg: agent.
Shawn Segal: got it. All right, sit tight and I will go uh install that and see if I can autofill the password or if I have to actually recover
Joshua Fischburg: Awesome. And bear with me if this cam camera angle is a little weird.
Shawn Segal: it.
Joshua Fischburg: It's uh it's it's actually my phone.
Shawn Segal: You're good.
Joshua Fischburg: My phone is pointed kind of it's yeah an interesting setup.
Shawn Segal: No worries.
Joshua Fischburg: I am working just the two of
Shawn Segal: Yeah, I see I see uh uh two of us.
Joshua Fischburg: us.
Shawn Segal: We can make it if we try.
Joshua Fischburg: Is this a new Is this a new guy? I hope.
Shawn Segal: Uh the guy that walked in.
Joshua Fischburg: No baby daddy.


00:11:43

Shawn Segal: Oh, no. No, it's not. It's it's it's it's the same old same old brother.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. When you have free eyes, let me know and I'll walk you through a couple of
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: things.
Shawn Segal: Yeah. Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: 160.
Joshua Fischburg: here.
Shawn Segal: Okay. I have free eyes. Show me. And Telegram should be installed now. No, almost installed.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Oh my god. f*** off. Okay, there we
Joshua Fischburg: Let me go to linear here.
Shawn Segal: go.
Joshua Fischburg: I just Oh, it did it in the web browser. It's not the app. That's fine. Um, okay. So, you've used typical chat stuff. you do stuff in the chat app and maybe it even generates some code for you, get some good answers, does some shopping and that kind of thing. The next wave that of the way things go is agentic. Um, which I'm sure you probably by now heard.


00:12:51

Joshua Fischburg: Um, but there's there's agentic and then there's agentic. So you you can define an agent to do some basic things for you or you can have an agent that manages and builds other agents and skills and helps you accomplish things. So um one piece of this is there's the whole communication piece like how do I
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: interact with my agent and this is my whole stream of conversation with the agent. So this agent is managing everything for me related to the
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: environments, but then it also delegates some agents to do some things.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: Those things include managing every single one of my projects. So there's a dedicated agent that will um let me show you. That's a good one. Okay, let me show you this one. So this app is linear. I'm a linear partner. Um, and everybody has the problem of making sure that you track things. I'm not sure how you do that. Now, this is, as far as I've seen, the pen ultimate um platform for creating projects, bringing teams in, and getting things done and staying organized.


00:14:11

Joshua Fischburg: And the reason is because what what I've done is I've integrated my agents with this. So they're not just, you know, it's not just an amorphous blob of holy crap, what's everything that's going on. I have many agents and they each manage a project and then there are specialist agents
Shawn Segal: Mhm.
Joshua Fischburg: and when they're doing stuff, they build they do a number of things for me. So let me show you what I'm doing for instance here. So this is all agent managed. I said you guys need to need to get my presentation together for uh the reverend here.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: She's going to the board and then here's what the process looks like. So
Shawn Segal: Okay. So,
Joshua Fischburg: it
Shawn Segal: Diane review is is the person Diane that you're going to sit with and go over that review. When it's done, the status will show that it's it's
Joshua Fischburg: correct? Yeah, it's it's all it's in fact it's all it's already done.
Shawn Segal: active.


00:15:00

Joshua Fischburg: I haven't updated it and I I just got her into this.
Shawn Segal: Ah, okay.
Joshua Fischburg: So this is a little bit of testing for her as well. Um, so I'm I'm getting them to adopt this platform as well so they can manage everything they have going on because today some people use spreadsheets, some people use email and and I was watching all these things fly through email saying how do you track this?
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: So what this does is it solves the problem of how do you have a number of agents that may be doing things for you like who knows what it is like it could be anything but then how how do you
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: um how do you understand what they're working on and how do you make sure that you know they have standard ways of doing things right so they are now building all of my presentations and they are building a standard set of documents for each one of these steps so why is this important I mean you
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: know I I think um and what I can do now is I can get into I think I have a Shan these are onboarding and handoff shard shell provisioning


00:15:58

Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: configuration so let's talk about this here hold on part shell client discovery all right so this is actually me now switching into the what would ultimately be the the discovery so uh we started off with chat and then they started doing some good things and you can integrate it into different platforms. The kind of the the next state is agentic but not just agentic as I mentioned agents managing agents and doing things for you to help you with the things that take a lot of time in your life and doing so in a repeatable high quality way and reporting it into a platform where you understand what's going on. Right? So you'll have a project. It'll be a member on that project. It reports to you. You get inbox messages when you have things to do and actually assigns work for you to do to review and approve and then it just does it. So um this platform is built on something called openclaw.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: Open open.
Shawn Segal: Yeah, you were telling me about open claw a little


00:17:12

Joshua Fischburg: Yeah. So open claw is what you're doing is you're saying hi AI here's a computer.
Shawn Segal: bit.
Joshua Fischburg: have a nice day. It's not restricted to a chat session. It can use anything that you have on that laptop. It can use the internet. It can use GPUs.
Shawn Segal: Oh,
Joshua Fischburg: If it finds your credit card,
Shawn Segal: okay.
Joshua Fischburg: it can and will use your credit card to
Shawn Segal: Yeah, you told me. Yeah. Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: this.
Shawn Segal: You told me that it arbitrarily used someone's card and you were like, "That shouldn't have happened. Why did it do that?" Because that's what it thought it it you wanted it to
Joshua Fischburg: Well,
Shawn Segal: do.
Joshua Fischburg: it had a goal. Its goal, its goal was to 10x uh this person's uh brand image in 90
Shawn Segal: Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: days.
Shawn Segal: Mhm.
Joshua Fischburg: And so it did the math and it said, "I need to be trained on this to meet my goal." So the five grand you just spent,


00:18:03

Joshua Fischburg: just give me 90 days and it'll be worth 50 grand. So some lessons learned. Number one, don't just install this thing on your laptop. People don't have generally always high enough spec hardware lying around to
Shawn Segal: Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: make this happen. And further, it it is potentially very dangerous if it's not secured properly.
Shawn Segal: Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: So,
Shawn Segal: So, question then,
Joshua Fischburg: yeah.
Shawn Segal: because when I got this new phone after my older one got stolen in Peru,
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah. Yeah. So,
Shawn Segal: remember?
Joshua Fischburg: I do
Shawn Segal: Um, since we got the new one, I am allowed to only download apps from the app store. Any other download Jordan put software on this phone so that he basically has a babysitter on it so that I don't f****** like Arcane banking information, AB3D banking information, and personal banking information. So, if this requires anything outside of Telegram for an install or a download, Jordan has to give me his approval.
Joshua Fischburg: Nope.
Shawn Segal: There are several third-party apps I've wanted on this phone where Jordan said, "Tough s***." No.


00:19:11

Shawn Segal: So, I I Does this require an a third party download?
Joshua Fischburg: So,
Shawn Segal: No. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.
Joshua Fischburg: so the whole reason this has been built is it's in a secure sandbox.
Shawn Segal: Cool.
Joshua Fischburg: Um,
Shawn Segal: Okay. It's contained within its own sandbox.
Joshua Fischburg: correct. Now,
Shawn Segal: Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. That makes it easier.
Joshua Fischburg: everything is hosted in Cloudflare. Um, and I'll tell you the typical way.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: So, we talked a while ago about wouldn't it be great if you could have just a database of all your customers and you know in some cases communicate with them. Obviously, you're in a restricted industry. It's a little bit different, but I'm going to give you a standard kind of use case and you can talk through
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: how this might apply to you. Um, I can tell you that this the unfortunate thing is that this isn't really
Shawn Segal: Okay.


00:20:00

Joshua Fischburg: a uh this is only designed for vape store owners or or churches or anything. Like literally, this is something that will take care of a whole bunch of stuff in a shockingly good way. Um, all of it is hosted on Cloudflare.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: If you haven't heard of Cloudflare,
Shawn Segal: I I I've heard of Cloud Flare. I am somewhat familiar with
Joshua Fischburg: okay,
Shawn Segal: Cloudflare.
Joshua Fischburg: Cloudflare started out as a security company and then they said, you know what,
Shawn Segal: Mhm.
Joshua Fischburg: running the cloud is insecure and expensive and it shouldn't be and they built an entire platform that does a number of things. Um so let me walk you through you know a couple of things. So this is not the right view. Um not adopt AI not AI security. Yes postquantum cryptography products. Okay. So, you know what? I think the easiest way is for me to log in and kind of walk you through a few things that I use and then tell you why we built the Is this Chrome?


00:21:13

Joshua Fischburg: No, it's Edge. Thank you. Um, tell you why it works. So, first of all, um, it hosts all your domains in one place. It's cheap. It has security for all your domains and it it will run it and manage it. Um then you know and when I say domains it does websites in a very specific high
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: performance way. They're all nodebased so they use TypeScript. You don't we don't have to get into the technology behind it but this is the this is the modern what
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: it Yeah.
Shawn Segal: Not that I would understand it to be completely transparent with you.
Joshua Fischburg: But but the the thing to note is that every platform that's being built today, like even Telegram, Netflix, Hulu, Apple's website, they're all built using this technology, they're not on WordPress, they're not using GoDaddy, they're not using Wix. Um, and so one of the things that I use this agentic stack for is to use a standard uh website template and to manage, build, add, and interact with with customers on my website.


00:22:19

Joshua Fischburg: Um, the entire thing is like all of this is
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: run through and and it even builds demos as technology updates and stuff like that. It posts on the website. runs the whole thing. It actually interacts with my Stripe and it it helps me with CFO types of decisions. Um, okay. So, great. So, that's that's a way to use it.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: That's number one. So, number one is it does the web hosting stuff, but then behind the scenes, it also has this concept called workers. And workers are just functions that have access
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: to uh compute. So, you know, how does it how does it crunch numbers and do things like that? Storage and memory. So, it's almost like take a it's like a a deconstructed computer and you can say I need this much compute. I need this much memory. I need to store it and it's going to solve a particular problem. So, these are all like problem and solution engineering types of things.


00:23:22

Joshua Fischburg: Each one of these are are exactly that. So, for instance, I have something in here.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: I've created an ERP database for my company and what it does is it syncs my products, my customers and my transactions with my own database so that customers can authenticate and I can know what types of things the customers will want next. It processes tasks.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: It has video um that
Shawn Segal: Could I could I upload a video to it and have it
Joshua Fischburg: it
Shawn Segal: analyze that video and tell me for say a presentation where I uh should how I should properly order and structure the presentation based on the information
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah. So,
Shawn Segal: presented
Joshua Fischburg: one thing I've actually built is almost identical to that. Um, no.
Shawn Segal: cuz like yesterday for example you know uh J Brands Tyson.
Joshua Fischburg: Yes.
Shawn Segal: So JB Brands has officially retained us as uh coaching consultants with their sales team both remote and physical.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Um, so Jordan and I put together a rather


00:24:30

Joshua Fischburg: Yeah.
Shawn Segal: robust training program with the help of of AI um based on our current training program and had it structure it in a way to make it uh presentable and then um his fiance Naen finished it and rounded it out the rest of the way for us. And then when I presented yesterday, I was there from uh 10:00 a.m. until about 6:30 p.m. Um after all was said and done, uh uh they professionally recorded the workshop, they're going to edit it and clip it and they want to use it for future stuff. Um and uh I was bas I was curious like with that video and the presentation,
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: I can upload that into what you have and have it tweak it, fine-tune it, and and all that fun stuff.
Joshua Fischburg: Yes. So let me let me explain the way agentic stuff
Shawn Segal: Okay. Oh,
Joshua Fischburg: works.
Shawn Segal: please.
Joshua Fischburg: It
Shawn Segal: Okay, hang on. Hey, how you doing? Mint ice.
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah.
Shawn Segal: I don't carry fume infinities.


00:25:35

Shawn Segal: I don't carry fume as a brand cuz to be honest with you, we haven't carried them since we opened our doors four years ago because they're kind of dog water. They're known as one of the like most unreliable brands in our industry. Um, most customers that like Fume Infinities go to the Iron Mics for us, which is Mike Tyson's brand of vapes. If you're looking for mint, you'd be looking at cool mint or menthol. And those guys look like that is the device. And the nice thing is you don't have to commit to the purchase in case you don't like it. All of these empty or open ones here are for your sampling pleasure with a individually wrapped silicone tip. So, this one is the mint. I will pull out the mint and menthol for you. Okay. Take that little guy. Pop it open.
Joshua Fischburg: No, I miss those Tyson's.
Shawn Segal: Dude, I I love Tyson's so much. They're such a fantastic
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah, I haven't found a place that has them here in


00:26:22

Shawn Segal: brand.
Joshua Fischburg: Washington.
Shawn Segal: s***. I mean, if you really really want Tyson, uh, I could always potentially ship them up to
Joshua Fischburg: Oh, that's that's that's so sweet. I mean,
Shawn Segal: you.
Joshua Fischburg: save save the save the cash, dude. I' I've got I have alternative brands that that are Washington State, I guess, approved brands because it works strangely like
Shawn Segal: Yeah,
Joshua Fischburg: that.
Shawn Segal: cuz you you guys have uh uh slightly different laws for vapes out there. I think that one was clear that I grabbed. That one's cool mint and menthol.
Joshua Fischburg: Yes.
Shawn Segal: Yeah, give those a try. And then on the bottom there's little airflow. So if you're like, "Yeah, I'm not really caring for that." Shut the air flow most of the way and take another hit on them and try them at their different intensities. But most most fume customers that come in when they sample they if they're just straight mint for fume, they grab one of those three. And if you want more intense flavor or heavier mint, I have in their legend line which looks like this.


00:27:18

Shawn Segal: We have uh menthol, Miami mint, cool mint, menthol gold, menthol green, and menthol silver. What do you think? It's just not the same, but I guess, you know, I I know it's not identical. Do you want to you want a bigger tip and you want to try some of the other menthol flavors that they do? Cuz fumes generally, it's a little tighter on the draw. It's a little more muted on the flavor for the mint. But these guys, the mint is a little stands up a little more. You get a little more freshness out of it. Okay. So, let me give you a larger tip. Okay. Open that one. And then in here we have not those menthol silver rancher Miami mint pineapple cool mint and same thing with the airflow adjustment on the bottom. Menthol, menthol gold and menthol green. And if if they fall over, it's all good. No worries. Yeah. Give give those a try.


00:28:36

Shawn Segal: Let's see if any of those. Mess with the air flow on the bottom, too. If you're like, "Whoa, that's too much." Close it some on that that bottom airflow. Pretty close. Cool. Okay, cool. Coolman's pretty close. Love that. My favorite is the menthol green out of their menthol line because it's a very like harsh winter green and I like my throat to be stabbed by icicles when I vape sometimes. I love tasting the sweet flavor. I don't like sweet. That's why I recommended the Irons over the Legends. The Legends they designed to closely mimic things like Fumi, large geek, large large RZ, Lost Mary Turbo. Whereas the irons are more so to mimic your like higher puff count HQDs, your Fume Ultras and Infinities, uh, uh, uh, your 50 bar, uh, and a couple other brands. They they kind of mimic off of that. And if you know, you're you don't have to commit to buying anything. We do the samples for free.


00:29:44

Shawn Segal: So, if if you're really not vibing and you want to go find your fume, that is totally okay as well. I greatly appreciate you entertaining me and giving me the opportunity to try to convert you to what in my opinion is a better brand. Cool. Cool. Gotcha. One. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. I think I think you're going to be like most of our other fume customers that once you have it for a couple of days, you get a little used to it, you're going to end up buying a fume again because most of them do and then they hate it afterwards and they keep coming back to Tyson. All right. I assume that you don't have a rewards account with us. I do. Oh, you do? Okay, cool. Then sign in and get your points. You might have points off the phone number. Another one. Pick Gordon. Yep. That is you. Yep.


00:30:38

Shawn Segal: You are good. All right. 27.82 after tax. How long does it last? They last a good minute. If I grab a legend, it normally lasts me about 2 weeks. Um, most customers are about 10 days to two weeks on one of those 30ks. We got some guys that like we have our guy Rio that came in this morning that he's a sushi chef and he's absolutely certifiably insane and he goes through two of them a week, but that's because he supplements oxygen for vapor and nicotine. That's what says I do. Yeah, you you should get at least a week on that. Even if you're a really heavy vapor, they have a really big reservoir in there and have a shitload of uh liquid. Rechargeable? Yes, rechargeable. So, when it dies or it gets down to about 15 20%, the flavor starts to degrade a little, plug it into your regular phone charger for like 30 45 minutes. Don't let it stay plugged in overnight or it could burn the coil.


00:31:29

Shawn Segal: Um, and then you're rocking and rolling again until the liquid percentage on it says zero. Perfect. Thanks, man. Beautiful. My pleasure. Enjoy. Good service. I appreciate it. Thanks. I appreciate it. Take care. Okay. Go ahead,
Joshua Fischburg: All right.
Shawn Segal: Josh. Cool.
Joshua Fischburg: Yes.
Shawn Segal: That was a successful conversion.
Joshua Fischburg: Yay. Um I hope I play my part.
Shawn Segal: We love successful conversions.
Joshua Fischburg: I I try to be the hype man.
Shawn Segal: Oh, no.
Joshua Fischburg: Um
Shawn Segal: I think I think I think you just chiming in with, "Man, I miss Tyson. I wish I could have it out here in Washington State." I think that kind of sealed the deal for him cuz the the look in his eyes like you can see my face,
Joshua Fischburg: Uh, so I kind of can hold on.
Shawn Segal: right?
Joshua Fischburg: Uh, yes. Now I
Shawn Segal: So, so when you said it, he went,


00:32:01

Joshua Fischburg: can
Shawn Segal: "Oh, really?" Like, okay. The look on his face, he's like, "All right, you got that guy vouching for it on the phone. Sure, I'll I'll I'll take a leap of faith. Why not?" So,
Joshua Fischburg: first try.
Shawn Segal: no, no, thank thanks for the uh thanks for the assist
Joshua Fischburg: There you go. No problem.
Shawn Segal: there.
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah, just uh mark me up on a on an assist commission.
Shawn Segal: Oh, I got you.
Joshua Fischburg: Um okay.
Shawn Segal: You you get a Tyson vape in your hand the next time you visit.
Joshua Fischburg: Um right so you were asking can it do that and the answer is yes with with a proviso. So these agents aren't panaceas for things.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: Um they can do anything. So let me show you we did the reason I'm saying yes is because we actually just did exactly that. uh for Seattle Unity, right? And one of the things that we're looking to do, basically what what they have is they they do live streams,


00:32:55

Shawn Segal: Please.
Joshua Fischburg: so it doesn't matter. The point is a video is created, you need an agent to divide up a video and then do something with it. And so,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: so I would say out of the gate, um something we could work on together. Um, but you know, uh,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: for you to get to that state, it's it's kind of a a little bit of learning for you to get there. And this is the reason why we build it in Cloudflare because you can just throw an agent at it and eventually it will get
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: it. But what you've done at that point in time is when you chat with um,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: chat GPT or or quote or whatever, you you have an all you can eat plan. But when you start using agents,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: you're using the API and every word in the API costs money.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: So you you will you cannot
Shawn Segal: And that's that's why you said that we would probably need like an API key.


00:33:51

Joshua Fischburg: use an agent without an API key. That's correct.
Shawn Segal: s***. Hang on. Hang on one second. The owner of Wicked is finally here.
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah.
Shawn Segal: Yo, I uh I I got off the phone with Shana earlier about the trash can or about the dumpster. Is Gar dumping food? And then uh uh another issue, but uh she took note of everything. She's going to talk with Waste Management about putting a bar on there and providing keys to all of us. Um because Waste Manage would be the one that have the keys to open it and dump it anyway. Um and then I sent her all the pictures from Isara and she was like, "Uh, cool. Send me the pictures. I'll pull the footage on our end and we'll we'll say something to them." So, but I told her, I was like, "It's unbelievably unfair for something out of our control as tenants to be charged extra because you guys don't want to put a lock on it." And she's like,


00:34:37

Shawn Segal: "Well, it's not us. It's waste management. This is one of three properties that Jackaranda owns where they have nothing to do with the trash management. It's all waste management. It's just them that manage it. So, thank you for the heads up. Oh, no. I got you. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah, just really f****** busy. So, which is a good and a bad thing. But, uh yeah. Yeah. So, I'll I'll follow up with Shana probably Monday or Tuesday next week and I'll let you know when you guys open back up on Wednesday if we get anything with that. Well, hopefully Isgar will stop their s*** after all those pictures and uh hopefully we got a bar and keys on the dumpster. Plus, that would help you with your inspections because it's going to have to be locked all the time. So, it'll have to be closed and locked. So, we'll see. Thank you. You got it. I uh I've turned into the uh the complex Karen over here.


00:35:26

Shawn Segal: I every every tenant comes to me except for the restaurant and the spa and they say,
Joshua Fischburg: Oh my
Shawn Segal: "Hey, can you call the property management and landlord and deal with them on this issue we're all experiencing experiencing?" And I go,
Joshua Fischburg: goodness.
Shawn Segal: "No, why can't you do it?" Because you're better at it than I am. f*** you. All right, I'll call
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah. Why am I not surprised that you're a complex?
Shawn Segal: them. Listen, I I'll wear the badge with pride,
Joshua Fischburg: There you go. All right. So,
Shawn Segal: Joshy.
Joshua Fischburg: um yeah, I mean I I can tell you about this thing and I could talk about it all day, but um the thing that's going to help me help you is ask you a few of these very specific questions. So, um first thing I'm going to do is just kind of note to Gemini that's taking notes on
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: this. Um, this is this is the start of our real discovery here.


00:36:20

Joshua Fischburg: We had a little bit of preamble and warm-up. Um, so the thing I want you to bear in mind is the context with which you would engage with an
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: agent. Just imagine you have a helper or a suite of helpers that can do anything you want. That could be working with email, working with inventory, working with anything.
Shawn Segal: Reminding me to send payroll.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. So with that,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: what do you do dayto-day? What's your role, industry, and the type of work that you
Shawn Segal: Cool. Uh,
Joshua Fischburg: do?
Shawn Segal: I am the owner operator of a smoke and vapor shop and the CFO of said smoke and vapor
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: shop.
Joshua Fischburg: And tell me about the people you work with, team size, clients, collaborators.
Shawn Segal: We work with a team size of six total people across several dozen vendors. Um, and I don't think we have any collaborators because we don't really collab on any products in the
Joshua Fischburg: you got J brands.


00:37:25

Shawn Segal: industry.
Joshua Fischburg: So
Shawn Segal: Oh,
Joshua Fischburg: potentially
Shawn Segal: okay. Yeah. Yeah, we could toss that in there. Yeah, potentially J Brands. That that's valid. That did just happen yesterday. Yes.
Joshua Fischburg: okay. Um,
Shawn Segal: See, we can put them as a
Joshua Fischburg: so now, uh, imagining and and some of this will be, you know, really tuned for you.
Shawn Segal: collaborator.
Joshua Fischburg: Um, but think about imagine you could just add as many reliable staff to do the kinds of things that you do that take you a lot of time. Are would would you need help with things like productivity,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: research, automation, delegation?
Shawn Segal: Yes. Research, delegation, reminders for things like annual renewals within our industry for anything local, municipal, state, federal. Um, reminders every 14 days for payroll, reminders to make the calendar for uh uh uh to make schedule calendar for everyone. Like there there's several things like I just set manual reminders in my phone on repeat every month.


00:38:28

Joshua Fischburg: Okay. And so let's let's touch on some of those. So imagine you could even take it to another level that your your schedule so you have rules that you create your schedule with and obviously people are giving availability and stuff like that. I'm not sure how you do it today, but if that could be automated, would that be
Shawn Segal: Yes. How I do it today,
Joshua Fischburg: helpful?
Shawn Segal: how I'm getting ready to do it today and tomorrow is I have a whiteboard that is sectioned like a monthly calendar and I color code that whiteboard, take a picture of it and post it to our Discord schedules channel.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Our sum up point of sale is supposed to have a digital scheduling platform that emails schedules and everything, but I can only build it one week at a time and we like to do the schedule for a full month in
Joshua Fischburg: I mean it it kind of makes sense for sure.
Shawn Segal: advance. Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: Um okay. And so imagine that you could wave a wand and obviously there are some things that you're going to have to do um you know in life like drive your car and things like that.


00:39:24

Shawn Segal: Mhm.
Joshua Fischburg: Well at least for at least for today. Um but um what would a perfect day look like?
Shawn Segal: Right.
Joshua Fischburg: So imagine today the things that stress you out cause you to have time sucked. Like talk walk me through like the before and after of of what that would look
Shawn Segal: Um,
Joshua Fischburg: like.
Shawn Segal: I I'm not sure how because I don't do the same things every day. Um, as things pop up and need to get done, I prioritize on like a, you know, a notepad list on my phone and then I knock out all of the tasks for the day or the week in priority order of like if there's deadlines for say like a state renewal or or county renewal on a on a on a c a certification or license, right? Um, so I I don't really have a particular set schedule of things I do every day. It's more like as the workload comes, it gets prioritized and done in that
Joshua Fischburg: Got it. Um, and how so perfect segue in into the next question.


00:40:28

Shawn Segal: order.
Joshua Fischburg: So, obviously you're made aware of these things that happen through a number of different ways, right? So, those are going to surface themselves through tools. So, that's going to be email, things like email,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: calendar, notes, project management software, other communication. What does that suite of tools look like that you're using
Shawn Segal: Uh we use email calendar notes uh
Joshua Fischburg: today?
Shawn Segal: Gemini um email calendar notes Gemini WhatsApp and you know regular text message outbound inbound phone
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: calls correct
Joshua Fischburg: And for email, you're using Gmail. Is that right?
Shawn Segal: Gmail.
Joshua Fischburg: You use a an email domain that's tied to your
Shawn Segal: Yeah, we were using an Outlook one. Uh we were using Outlook for like Sean at Arcanevapes,
Joshua Fischburg: company.
Shawn Segal: Jordan at arcanevapes.com. However, from me going back and forth to Peru, it has like screwed up my Outlook account really bad and I have gotten to the point of frustration with Outlook that we're not we didn't renew it and we dropped them.


00:41:38

Joshua Fischburg: Okay. I mean to be uh to to be honest, I've actually moved things over to Google personally. So everything that I do is with Google and Gmail
Shawn Segal: I prefer Google.
Joshua Fischburg: and
Shawn Segal: I I'd rather have like Google do uh Google domain or something like that. I I can't f****** stand Outlook. I hate Outlook so
Joshua Fischburg: yeah. Yeah. I mean I canceled this thing and I kept sending them emails.
Shawn Segal: much.
Joshua Fischburg: They keep trying to charge me. It's kind of hilarious actually. U but uh Okay. So that's Google for calendar. You use a Google calendar as well.
Shawn Segal: Mhm.
Joshua Fischburg: How do you keep yourself?
Shawn Segal: Yes
Joshua Fischburg: How do you keep yourself organized and make sure you don't lose things that you need to
Shawn Segal: sir.
Joshua Fischburg: do?
Shawn Segal: Manually creating events or tasks and then setting uh the time frame for the event or task and setting manual reminders through Google Calendar.
Joshua Fischburg: Would you be open to a new solution that would actually schedule that and actually help you prioritize and and track all of the tasks that you have open in a more professional manner?


00:42:39

Shawn Segal: Yeah,
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: I absolutely I'd be down for that. And then hang on. How you doing? What you in for? Come on. The blue Scotty. The seven pack. This guy. Or do you want a single? Yeah. These are joints, but the difference is this is a single one and a half g joint. These are smaller, but you get 3.5 g. They're half gram joints. They have a striker and a matchbox. It's magnetic. you open it and slide the bell. Oh, it's it's if you want um multiple pre-rolls like throughout the week. These are for the people that it's like, I'm going to buy this on, you know, Thursday or Friday and I'm going to smoke this through the weekend. I'll be back, you know, next Wednesday or Thursday for the weekend. Oh, those last me like a whole week. Just one of those. One of those. All right.


00:43:21

Shawn Segal: Yeah, no worries. I got you. Can we um see the blue? Yes. Yeah. Can I get like Yeah, absolutely. interrupt your phone. No, you're good. You're good. I didn't anticipate uh my uh my my manager calling out last. Oh, yes. Please, Reed. Thank you. Yeah, I didn't even catch that. Listen, I've been all over the place today. Do you have a rewards account with us, Lo? I do. Okay, go ahead and sign in when you're ready so you can get your points. Oh, literally take both of them off Reed and keep them back to back and then just flip the sheet. Flip them inverse so they're back to back and then rotate it so that the bathroom sign faces in. Yeah. So that one's showing exactly. Yeah. Perfect. Yep. That's it. Perfect. Thanks, sir. Appreciate that. Cool.


00:44:20

Shawn Segal: Roxan. Yes. Awesome. Uh, do you want to use your five or save it? Save it. Okay. Cool. So, we'll skip pay 3210 after tax. You want a bag? Yes, sir. You want a receipt? Okay, good to go. Love my pleasure. Enjoy. We'll see you next week. What's your format? Black and blue. You want sour blue ras glass or blue rice? Oh, they got two blue ras. Sour blue ras and blue. Oh, blue. Anything else? These realm Yeah, those gummies are f****** killing it for us. Everybody loves those gummies so far. They're cheap. The the 60 mgram pack is $8, I think, and the 2,00 milligram is 10. Let's see. Probably the best seller out of the four strain ones there is the blue dream hybrid. That one has has sold the best for us. Yeah.


00:45:50

Shawn Segal: After that, it would probably be Agent Orange for the sativa. Sure. Okay. Anything else? No, it's going to be awesome. 4280 after tax and then yes, you want to use any points or save them? Save them. 4280. Give me your money, Reed. I had a guy earlier that played along a little too hard when I was like, "Give me your money." And he took his card and very sensually inserted in. He goes, "Yeah, you like that?" And I was like, "I wasn't prepared for this." I was like, I was going for this one joke and you you kind of took it over the top, dog. Damn freak. Yeah. Like I was like, honestly, I was like, damn. Like, I I kind of want to be invited to like a party you go to or some s*** cuz I'm like borderline on that line of freakiness, you know? Like at least it didn't look in your eyes. No, no, not at all.


00:46:52

Shawn Segal: Not at all. He just played on the joke and it was still entertaining, but I was like, I didn't expect that out of that man's mouth. Like that's funny. Yeah. Oh man. Did Peru uh safe to go back to now? They uh they just uh removed the current sitting president that replaced the other president from August last year. Peru has gone through six presidents in the past four years and five out of the six of them have been forcibly forcibly removed out of office and one of them was murdered. So Peru right now is very very unsafe. So we were like, "Oh, you know, Fernando's best friend lives in Mexico. Let's go stay in Mexico for a few weeks. f*** that. Absolutely not. Not with the cartels and s*** down there in Puerto Varta. You got me f***** up. Yep. No, we're good. We're going to stay right here for probably the rest of this year. Yeah. Have a good one, Reed.


00:47:47

Shawn Segal: Okay,
Joshua Fischburg: Hi.
Shawn Segal: I'm back.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Uh,
Shawn Segal: Hello.
Joshua Fischburg: okay. Uh, where'd I get to? I was just doing some other things while we're waiting. Right. So, we talked about calendar. How Oh, you talked about how you manage your tasks. You're using whiteboard, etc. some other calendar bits and pieces.
Shawn Segal: Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: Where where do your most important files live?
Shawn Segal: Mhm.
Joshua Fischburg: What is your storage stack look
Shawn Segal: Uh,
Joshua Fischburg: like?
Shawn Segal: our most important physical files are in a filing cabinet and our most important digital files are stored on our shop PC and in our uh shared one drive.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Um, in terms of communication, I know you use Discord, but you know what else do you use? Do you use Slack, Teams,
Shawn Segal: Discord, Discord, WhatsApp,
Joshua Fischburg: WhatsApp,
Shawn Segal: and a regular text message. Occasionally Instagram because of socials for the shop too for
Joshua Fischburg: very good. Um,


00:48:49

Shawn Segal: customers.
Joshua Fischburg: building on that, socials, what kind of things are you posting? What platforms are you working with? And what are your goals?
Shawn Segal: only Instagram. We're currently posting nothing because we've been shadowbanned for the better part of a year. So, anything we post automatically gets removed or um uh it doesn't actually show to anybody except people that are following us and have notifications turned on.
Joshua Fischburg: Oh
Shawn Segal: So, we have kind of given up on social media across the board for Arcane for the foreseeable future because of the age
Joshua Fischburg: yeah.
Shawn Segal: restrictiveness. No platform wants like I don't know how some of these large brands maintain their presence on social media without constantly getting their accounts removed but we uh we got multiple notices from Instagram and Facebook or Meta that they were going to uh delete our accounts if we continue to violate their terms of
Joshua Fischburg: If that could be solved,
Shawn Segal: service.
Joshua Fischburg: would you want a solution for
Shawn Segal: Absolutely.
Joshua Fischburg: it?
Shawn Segal: I would love to be able to automate uh uh some kind of social media within their terms of


00:49:47

Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: service.
Joshua Fischburg: Um, next, let's talk about your pain. Oh, the pain.

Joshua Fischburg: vacuum. Um,
Shawn Segal: Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: what takes the most time in your week that you wish could be
Shawn Segal: Um,
Joshua Fischburg: faster.
Shawn Segal: it's a good question. What does take the most time in my week? Oh, uh, uh, definitely orders and managing inventory.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Yeah,
Joshua Fischburg: What things do you what things do you repeat over and over that should be
Shawn Segal: we're not quite automated yet.
Joshua Fischburg: automated and okay
Shawn Segal: Inventory management, payroll, scheduling,
Joshua Fischburg: scheduling?
Shawn Segal: uh, orders. Um, yeah, that's all I can think of off the top of my head.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Um, what are the things that fall through the cracks most often?


00:50:53

Shawn Segal: Um, that's a good
Joshua Fischburg: There's a
Shawn Segal: question.
Joshua Fischburg: question.
Shawn Segal: Um, probably keeping like maintaining a healthy stock level. Um, just because of the amount of vendors that we purchase with and manufacturers. um things being on back order, then trying to source them outside of the manufacturer, from other distributors, or in the very rare off chance, um trying to source from other shops that might have dead inventory that's not expired. Um cuz we have a couple of times with people that we know that have shops like,
Joshua Fischburg: Interesting.
Shawn Segal: "Oh, you have this product that doesn't move for you. We'll buy it from you cuz it moves like crazy for
Joshua Fischburg: Wow. Okay,
Shawn Segal: us."
Joshua Fischburg: that's a that's a great use case. Um,
Shawn Segal: Yeah.
Joshua Fischburg: imagine you had unlimited sums of money to pay people just to do things. Uh, not physically, but things that require, you know, uh, a a digital interaction. What would you pay that person to do?
Shawn Segal: with unlimited funds.


00:52:05

Shawn Segal: s***, we're talking basically an assistant that can, you know, do half of the s*** that I normally do for the monotonous, tedious stuff and then just come to me for approvals on things of like, hey, I put this order together.
Joshua Fischburg: Awesome.
Shawn Segal: I put this this schedule together for the next month. Um, just, you know, glance over it and approve it for me. Awesome. Stuff like
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Um, now I kind of know the answer to this.
Shawn Segal: that.
Joshua Fischburg: Have you used chat petite cloud and other AP or other AI tools before? I know the answer is yes.
Shawn Segal: Never. Not Not once.
Joshua Fischburg: I I will state for the record I know the answer is yes and you're being sarcastic.
Shawn Segal: ever
Joshua Fischburg: How have you engaged with those? Has it been just the web browser? Have you been using the apps? You know, have you
Shawn Segal: apps primarily for me primarily Gemini with the app because my uh new phone and


00:52:46

Joshua Fischburg: Okay,
Shawn Segal: phone plan include the Gemini enterprise suite or whatever it's called for free for like a year
Joshua Fischburg: that's great.
Shawn Segal: or whatever.
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah,
Shawn Segal: It's it's way better than regular Gemini that you don't pay for.
Joshua Fischburg: I
Shawn Segal: It gives such more robust and detailed answers to things and it it's just a it's a better the the paid service is astronomically better than the free
Joshua Fischburg: absolutely. Yeah. No, I'm I'm with you on that for sure.
Shawn Segal: one.
Joshua Fischburg: Um, what works well? What like what do you what do you use about it and what what's great? What blows you away?
Shawn Segal: Uh I can actually tell you because I'll pop into the Gemini app real quick and go over some of my prompts. Um, so, uh, I used it when we were moving into our new condo for, uh, laws in the state of Florida for what landlord landlords are legally required to do. Um, I use that throughout the move in process and to deal with certain like stipulations in the lease and CTL and HOA docs and all that to find out what was legal, what's not, what is enforceable, what's not.


00:53:53

Shawn Segal: Um, and what recourse I may have if our landlord continues to not repair the mold and water leak in our bathroom. Um, I also had it uh help me out with a workout routine getting back into the gym. I gave it all of my medical history that was relevant. um what my goals and timeline was for muscle gain and weight loss and it built me a personalized plan for the next for this year to follow to accomplish that. Um I also use it for uh things like stupid for my birthday last month. I used it to find me all of the free things I could possibly get on my birthday or the week of my birthday. I use it for hobby stuff uh with uh uh One Piece. I use it for work with the smoke shop for like figuring out optimal margins and negotiation strategies for negotiating down price points when I can't negotiate it down myself. Stuff like that. I use it for a lot of different things
Joshua Fischburg: Sweet. Um, okay.


00:54:50

Joshua Fischburg: So,
Shawn Segal: actually.
Joshua Fischburg: the next has to do with um what you would be comfortable with. So, for each of these um the answer, please answer yes. Yes, with limits or no.
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: Are you comfortable giving an AI access to your email,
Shawn Segal: Yes with limits.
Joshua Fischburg: calendar,
Shawn Segal: Yes.
Joshua Fischburg: files?
Shawn Segal: Yes. With
Joshua Fischburg: Okay, good.
Shawn Segal: limits.
Joshua Fischburg: So, now let's talk about um hard shell. So, that's this product. Uh what's the number one thing that you would want Hard Shell to do for you?
Shawn Segal: out of all of the the pain points and everything we
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah. Like what what is the what is the if you could solve this for me,
Shawn Segal: discussed.
Joshua Fischburg: I would hug you and kiss you. I'm not saying I would actually want the hugs and kisses. I'm really saying you would you
Shawn Segal: Right. Right. Theoretically, right, I get you. Wow. Honestly,


00:55:47

Joshua Fischburg: would Well,
Shawn Segal: I'm I'm a little offended that you wouldn't want hugs and kisses from me. I thought we were homies, dude. Um All right.
Joshua Fischburg: it just depends where
Shawn Segal: I mean, listen, I'm not gay, but 20 bucks is 20 bucks, brother. Like, I I'll I'll work it out. Um, I would say inventory management and order automation are probably is probably the number one thing as as a little like two for bundle,
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: you know?
Joshua Fischburg: Is there anything that explicitly you would not want hard shell to do or touch?
Shawn Segal: I wouldn't want it to touch our most sensitive uh internal documents with like employee information, socials, like all of the really sensitive information that should not be in any kind of digital platform. Uh you know, that type of stuff I wouldn't want it to have access to or to
Joshua Fischburg: Do you have that information schismed in such a way that it would be clear that
Shawn Segal: touch.
Joshua Fischburg: these are out of bounds?
Shawn Segal: Not currently, but it could be


00:56:46

Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: done.
Joshua Fischburg: Um, do you want such an agent to be proactive like to check in with you, remind you, surface things, alerts?
Shawn Segal: Yes,
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: absolutely. I if if I have not gotten something done after it has assigned me tasks in a prioritized
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: order based on my workload, uh I I would want it within certain stipulations to be like, "Hey buddy, you still need to get this done. Get it done."
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Very good. Um, what about its personality when it interacts with you?
Shawn Segal: Yeah,
Joshua Fischburg: What what kind of personal assistant motivates you best
Shawn Segal: unbelievably sarcastic and racist. No, I'm kidding. Um uh whatever one is uh
Joshua Fischburg: because we give we give this we give this a soul and a personality. So if you can think of a person that would be your ideal assistant,
Shawn Segal: right?
Joshua Fischburg: imagine you could have anybody from any time ever that would be working for you. Who would it be that would help you to to motivate you and get it done?


00:57:45

Shawn Segal: Oh god. Honestly, probably one of my best friends, Nicole, cuz she she she was she is very like strict, regimented, scheduled. Things get done by deadlines. If it's coming up on a deadline, I'm going to remind you multiple times, and then when we get to like a point of no return where you're running out of time, I am going to sit down and make you get this done and not allow you to become
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: distracted.
Joshua Fischburg: So I think I think you hit on a few points there. So that's good. Um so there there are some characteristics. Um what devices would you use this agent from? Laptop, phone, tablet,
Shawn Segal: pro. Uh,
Joshua Fischburg: others.
Shawn Segal: all of the above. If if I have all of the above, probably all of the above. I want it to be congruent across all of those
Joshua Fischburg: Okay. Um are there any specific integrations that would be must haves?
Shawn Segal: platforms.
Joshua Fischburg: So by that I'm thinking, you know, if you if you want this agent to understand inventory levels, orders, potential opportunistic buys, like it would need to have access to your merch system.


00:58:54

Shawn Segal: Right.
Joshua Fischburg: Uh so you know,
Shawn Segal: Right.
Joshua Fischburg: and and I think the extent of what that access would be, you know, we'd need to discuss, but
Shawn Segal: Yeah, we need to get probably an API key from sum up to give it access to all of the inventory and back office for scheduling and and stuff like that. Inventory management, tracking, ordering.
Joshua Fischburg: or or you can give it a login and
Shawn Segal: Um or yeah,
Joshua Fischburg: and
Shawn Segal: or I could just give it a a login like everyone else does. Um, okay. So,
Joshua Fischburg: yeah
Shawn Segal: specific integrations would be yeah, that like integrated with our our point of sale, inventory tracking, management, scheduling, that type of stuff, sales in, sales out, uh, shrinkage, stuff like that. Uh, and as ridiculous as it sounds, I would also personally want an integration for like a daily motivational message to kind of put yourself in the right mindset to start your day or a quote or something. Um, and I would also like some kind of integration for uh um Oh man, I just had it.


01:00:00

Shawn Segal: Um, oh uh uh jokes.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: I like to laugh.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: So like a daily a daily motivational quote or or saying or something and then like a daily ridiculous
Joshua Fischburg: Fair.
Shawn Segal: joke would be a cool integration to have. Start your day on a positive note and on a humorous note and then you can seize the day. In my opinion, I I try to do something that makes me laugh every day and look at something motivational every day at this point so I can have myself in a
Joshua Fischburg: Beautiful.
Shawn Segal: more positive, higher frequency mindset. Kind of conquer the
Joshua Fischburg: Um, and so just to recap,
Shawn Segal: day.
Joshua Fischburg: you mentioned inventory and all those things. Is that all in sum up?
Shawn Segal: Yes, correct. Everything is in sum now.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay,
Shawn Segal: Uh Clover is actually been disconnected and taken off of the register now that we're moving forward with our our stuff with George.
Joshua Fischburg: great.
Shawn Segal: So,
Joshua Fischburg: Bye, Clover.


01:00:49

Joshua Fischburg: Roll over.
Shawn Segal: bye b****.
Joshua Fischburg: Um, okay.
Shawn Segal: I pay my bills. My bills are
Joshua Fischburg: So, uh,
Shawn Segal: paid.
Joshua Fischburg: at this point that concludes the discovery. If, um, what I'm thinking is we should have a part two and then I'm going to present back to you and give you a a proof of
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: concept of of your system, what it looks like. integrations won't be in there yet,
Shawn Segal: Okay.
Joshua Fischburg: but you know, the the little baseline bits and pieces would be and I'll set up a Cloudflare account for you and and it will be instantiated and ready to go.
Shawn Segal: Okay, cool. I'm I'm excited to try this out.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Um uh you want to follow up sometime beginning to midway through next week cuz from after we get off the phone,
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah.
Shawn Segal: I have this meeting with this dude that's coming in that interrupted us in the beginning.
Joshua Fischburg: Sure.
Shawn Segal: I have another like two phone calls that I have to do outbound, a couple coming in, finish with the store today, and then I'm like booked up through Sunday.


01:01:46

Shawn Segal: We have events over the weekend I'm going to and stuff like that for uh uh our industry and other
Joshua Fischburg: So, Thursday,

Joshua Fischburg: 2 pm Eastern time.

Joshua Fischburg: And it's funny.


01:02:32

Joshua Fischburg: I'm looking up because my phone is down here.
Shawn Segal: got it.
Joshua Fischburg: But what it should really be do is this. I need to get a monitor with a camera so I can actually not look like Yeah.
Shawn Segal: Ah, yeah. Yeah, I got you. I got you. Hey, brother. How you doing? Good, man. I'm good. What you in for? Sit tight just a minute, Josh, because uh once I'm done with this uh customer here, I want to uh briefly go over all the stuff with uh with George, too, so we can have like a full closed loop for for this week on my end as well.
Joshua Fischburg: W please wait.
Shawn Segal: And that is my other call that I was telling you about. I will message him that I will call him back. Cool. What you get? Uh, do you have peach ice harass? Uh, I have Georgia Peach. I haven't seen Peach Ice specifically since like midway through last year.


01:03:27

Shawn Segal: Most of our vendors removed it off their order forms. Where's Georgia Peach? Georgia peach is here for the for the bigger one. All right. Uh okay. I don't want the bigger one. Can How about the watermelon ice in the smallie? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've got tons of watermelon ice. Perfect. Take one of those. What? Awesome. Anything else? That's it. Do you have a rewards account with us? Yes. Go ahead and sign in. Is that an actual Ridge wallet? Yes. Ah, the best. We custom make our own. Really? Yeah. Nice. 3D printed. Very cool. Yeah. Yeah, I've been rocking with this one for almost a year and uh worst that's happened is a little bit of discoloration on the the white band, but other than that, this thing has stood the test of time so far.


01:04:07

Shawn Segal: With the ridge, the key piece, and it's supposed to have a clip and it broke first day I got it. That sucks. Especially cuz how expensive those things are. But great. The wallet's great. I love it. I get a lot of compliments on the wallet. Yeah, we Well, I I wanted a Ridge wallet, but I didn't want to pay 80 plus f****** dollars for a Ridge wallet. So, we do our own 3D printing manufacturing and our guy Jeremy was like, "I think I can make those." And then he did a couple of like test it, perfected it, and now he has like perfected ridge. They're they're amazing and they're super f****** cheap compared to how much he uh we sell them. They range from between I actually just wrote this down because with our last batch, we were able to reduce pricing as well. We're able to get better volume on some of our filament and other things. As it turns out, when you buy a hundred of these, they're kind of expensive for the little like screws and set screws and stuff, but when you buy 10,000 of them, they get astronomically.


01:05:04

Shawn Segal: A hundred of these little grommet things is like $40, $50. 10,000 of them is like $50, $60. So, it's like what, you know, it's like why wouldn't I just buy the insane bulk amount, you Okay, so our Ridge wallets, they range between $14 and $25 depending on what you want and how customized you want it. Like this was a customized print across several different colors. Ate up a lot of different filament in their like respective uh uh holsters, if you will. You can only fit so many in the in the holster of of filament spools. Um, so this one would be closer to like the 25 because of how many colors involved. It just has to work a lot harder. But if you were to get, you know, a basic two to three color concept one, you'd be like $15 to $18. Yeah, they're they're very reasonable. So, good to know. Yeah, love that. Really solid. If you're interested in any 3D printed stuff we do for any kind of thing, over in the top right corner of that Metagenics case, there are pink uh business cards that are also 3D printed that have Jeremy's name on it.


01:06:11

Shawn Segal: Feel free to take a couple and if there's something you're ever interested in. Thanks. You know, we got you. 2247. Cool. Give me your money. Thank you. Please. Yes. I can afford lunch today. Okay. You want a receipt?
Joshua Fischburg: She's
Shawn Segal: No. Good. Okay. Uh those are uh nicotine pouches made by Mike Tyson. Nice. Have you ever tried a nicotine pouch? Yeah. But free sample if you want. Good. Good. Cool. Because I got samples of all sorts of brands of these. Very cool. So I appreciate it, man. Thank you. Awesome. You got it. Take care. Enjoy. Thanks.
Joshua Fischburg: Hello.
Shawn Segal: Hello. Okay. So, um are are we good?
Joshua Fischburg: I
Shawn Segal: Are we good on uh on the uh your end for for the onboarding thing and initial
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah, we've got everything we need.


01:07:05

Shawn Segal: stuff?
Joshua Fischburg: Sorry, I turned you off. I had I had some cross traffic.
Shawn Segal: Absolutely. Okay, cool. No,
Joshua Fischburg: So,
Shawn Segal: no, you're totally fine. Um I'm only going to keep you for another 3 to 5 minutes and then I got to go return all these other calls that I missed.
Joshua Fischburg: yeah. Yeah. What's up,
Shawn Segal: Um so, oh, and then f****** TJ is coming in. TJ is going to sit here for a while. God damn it. Um so, uh uh for George, him and I met on Monday this week and we went over next steps. Uh we decided with Valmar that we're going to take them to small claims if they don't respond by this upcoming Monday. Uh we're going to go for the max amount out of small claims and George is going to hold my hand and walk me through that process. George's law firm has changed their policy on litigation and pre-litigation. Um the way that they altered it is going forward they now require all commercial litigation clients or all commercialbased clients um to have and maintain a $5,000 minimum retainer balance.


01:08:01

Shawn Segal: And if we end up doing any kind of pre-litigation or litigation, then that bumps up to a $50,000 minimum retainer balance.
Joshua Fischburg: Oh,
Shawn Segal: and George has been fighting with his partners on it to the point where he's ready to leave the law firm and just start
Joshua Fischburg: there.
Shawn Segal: his own. So, he said for the Valmar stuff, he's going to do that privately outside of his firm with me because it's small claims and he owes me a little bit from
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah.
Shawn Segal: uh all of the these issues and hassles. I told you about his associate quitting, right?
Joshua Fischburg: No.
Shawn Segal: His asso his associate that was our associate on on the case. You know what an associate is, right? So, uh,
Joshua Fischburg: Yes.
Shawn Segal: his associate build us like $1,600 something dollars for work and didn't do most of it. So, I I refused to pay the bill. And George was like, "No, don't pay the bill." Because she did that with multiple clients,
Joshua Fischburg: That's
Shawn Segal: he has to try to sort it out with the partners and billing.


01:08:48

Shawn Segal: It's a giant f****** mess. So, um, George has to sort that billing out, but with the and because of her and the billing and the fact that we don't have, uh, enough of a retainer left that we are a contributing factor to that revised policy. So, he's going to do the small claim stuff outside of the firm with us privately. And then for the stuff with the firm for uh Clover First data, he's going to build a budget, a six-month and a one-year budget, depending on how long it could take. We'll go over the budget and either approve or deny it. And uh he said depending on how that budget looks and where he's at with this firm, he might just leave and open his own private firm. Um and then he said, "I get to do whatever hourly I on. He said, "Then I can really sufficiently take care of you guys and and a few other clients that I brought with me and and all that b*******." So, we're we're currently working through that, but we're supposed to get together on Monday to go over the budget and start the process if Valar doesn't answer the phone for their legal counsel um taking them to small claims court over it.


01:09:45

Shawn Segal: So,
Joshua Fischburg: What's Mlay or
Shawn Segal: and then we have uh No,
Joshua Fischburg: something?
Shawn Segal: and it's different state by state. In the state of Florida, I think it's seven I think it's seven in Florida.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Don't don't quote me on that, though. I I but seven is sticking in my brain for some reason. I think it's I think it's between 7 and 10 for the state of Florida, but uh uh different states are different. So, we'll we'll see. And at the end of the day with our demand letter, I only requested I said, "I want all of my money back and $1,000 for for for pain and suffering," which equates to like between two and three grand. Nothing for a company of that size. And they were like, "Go f*** yourself. You're in breach of contract." And they haven't been able to provide a contract because we never signed a contract. And I have in writing that there was no contract and we will be monthtomonth by their director of customer relations.


01:10:28

Shawn Segal: So you know here we
Joshua Fischburg: My god. Let's Does that Does that have any bearing on our
Shawn Segal: are almost done TJ.
Joshua Fischburg: plan?
Shawn Segal: Uh no it has no bearing on our plan at the moment. We we are not on track but we are on track if that makes sense for the first of the month. And what I mean by that is we are February is always our slowest month of the year for a few different factors. It's the shortest month of the year. Everybody is done with the holidays.
Joshua Fischburg: Okay.
Shawn Segal: Kids are back in school. So everybody's pinching pennies January, February because of all the holiday expenses, November, December. And uh also the fact that New Year's resolutions are a thing. Most people that vape try to quit vaping.
Joshua Fischburg: Are you
Shawn Segal: And then the statistic in our industry is if that customer hasn't returned by March 1st,
Joshua Fischburg: okay?
Shawn Segal: they're not coming back. If they come back before March 1st, they give up on that resolution from a psychological marketing standpoint and they're going to be coming back until next year and they're probably going to try it again the following year.


01:11:24

Shawn Segal: Right? So, uh, with that, we are like this month was still decent for us on sales, but with two days left, we're not anywhere near where we wanted to be,
Joshua Fischburg: Yeah,
Shawn Segal: but we're still within a uh our expectation range. So, we're we're still on track, but we're not, if that makes sense now.
Joshua Fischburg: beautiful.
Shawn Segal: So,
Joshua Fischburg: Got you.
Shawn Segal: like, I wish we could have got more out of this month, but 28 days and the other stipulations aside, like I I can't complain.
Joshua Fischburg: Excellent.
Shawn Segal: We we still have put down some solid sales days this month that helped pick up the slack. though. Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to when we reconvene next week, let's set a date and an amount uh that I can confirm via email and I will do scheduled zels on that your preferred date every month until the balance is satisfied in full. My only request from you is every month after that zel is sent,
Joshua Fischburg: Beautiful.
Shawn Segal: please send us a new statement reflecting the current balance. Perfect. All right.
